`iProFun`
=========

An *i*ntegrative analysis tool to screen for *Pro*teogenomic *Fun*ctional traits perturbed by DNA copy number alterations (CNA) and DNA methylation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal is to characterize functional consequences of DNA copy number and methylation alterations in tumors and to facilitate screening for cancer drivers contributing to tumor initiation and progression, since CNAs and DNA methylations that preserve functional consequences are more likely to be cancer drivers.

We applied iProFun to the ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, and identified a large number of CNAs and methylations affecting the RNA expression and/or protein/phosphoprotein abundances.

### Installation

You can install:

-   the most recent officially-released version from CRAN with

    ``` r
    install.packages("iProFun")
    ```

-   the latest development version from GitHub with

    ``` r
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("sfirke/iProFun")
    ```
