Description: The goal of iProFun is to 1) characterize functional consequences of DNA copy number and methylation alterations in tumors 2)facilitate screening for cancer drivers contributing to tumor initiation and progression, since CNAs and DNA methylations that preserve functional consequences are more likely to be cancer drivers.
